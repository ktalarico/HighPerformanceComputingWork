Formulas:
Branch rate = RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR / RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
Branch misprediction rate = RETIRED_MISPREDICTED_BRANCH_INSTR / RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
Branch misprediction ratio = RETIRED_MISPREDICTED_BRANCH_INSTR / RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR
Branch taken rate = RETIRED_TAKEN_BRANCH_INSTR / RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
Branch taken ratio = RETIRED_TAKEN_BRANCH_INSTR / RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR
Instructions per branch = RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS / RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate. The same applies for the branches
taken metrics.
